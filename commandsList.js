/*This would be a JSON file, but I'm aiming to keep this as static as possible.
In the future, I'm also interested in removing this file in exchange for just showing the list of commands straight from lemonbot
The challenge to accessing commands remotely boils down to potential attacks & if we need to shard lemonbot: find a way to push a general list instead of using lemonbot.*/
